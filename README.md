# Lightweight Fine-Tuning Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a **Lightweight Fine-Tuning** project, focusing on the fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) or machine learning models using efficient techniques. The project is designed to optimize performance with minimal computational resources, making it suitable for various applications requiring fine-tuning of pre-trained models.

## Overview

The project explores lightweight fine-tuning techniques, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), with the goal of reducing resource usage while maintaining or improving model performance. This notebook demonstrates how to apply fine-tuning techniques to improve model accuracy, reduce overfitting, and minimize training time.

### Key Features
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Demonstrates how to fine-tune pre-trained models on custom datasets with minimal computational overhead.
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Focuses on reducing memory and processing requirements for fine-tuning tasks.
- **Performance Analysis**: Includes evaluation metrics to assess model improvements after fine-tuning.

## Files in the Repository

- **LightweightFineTuning_Project_Course2.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the fine-tuning process.
